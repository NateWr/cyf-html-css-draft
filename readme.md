Here's a draft of the HTML/CSS portion of the first two lessons. The idea is to start with a simple page (`index.html`/`stylesheet.css`, see [screenshot](screenshot-start.png)) and build it into a nicer page (`complete.html`/`complete-stylesheet.css`, see [screenshot](screenshot-complete.png)). I just took Bikes for Refugees and ran with it, but we may want to choose a Glasgow-based organisation instead, or a fake one!

The [Course Outline](course-outline.md) includes enough details that anyone should be able to run the class. I've tried to follow a pattern whereby the tutor demonstrates a new technique, and the students then have to apply that technique to something else on their own or in pairs.

I wasn't sure how much we could cover, but each lesson is intended to take about 2-3 hours, or ~60% of each day, as we discussed.

My thinking is that JavaScript lessons could be added in as desired. For instance, the Donate Now button could increment the number of bikes that have been donated. Or you can just dump JavaScript widgets or other things into wherever you'd like.

I've used Bootstrap 4 just because they're going to be a bit familiar with Bootstrap. I built it in Bootstrap 4 before realizing they were using Bootstrap 3. I can adjust as necessary, depending on what we want to do. (I don't use Bootstrap typically so don't have an opinion.)

The course outline is written for the mentors. We probably want to separate mentor instructions from student instructions, for instance in the homework. But I thought someone else might have ideas of how they want to structure the syllabus content.
